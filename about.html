        <p class="abouttext1">I am Aiden Famili, a student currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design (Co-op) program at Algonquin 
            College. I live walking distance away from the campus which is always convenient knowing that I can walk there in a 
            matter of minutes. Throughout my entire student life, I have always been involved in computers and making content.
            Whether it was making digital art or creating and editing a video, I was always involved in that field.</p>

        </div>
        
        <h1 class="aidenheading">AIDEN</h1>

        <p class="aidenabouttext">I have been in this field ever since High School of Grade 10, where I took my first Communications Technology course and that changed my whole perspective for my future. I would begin editing small videos for myself outside of school on my
            phone and at school for assignments. It was the most fun I had taking a class, and then proceeded to take the same class again in Grade 11 and 12. I would learn basic fundamentals as well as advanced techniques on most Adobe platforms.</p>

        <p class="photographyabouttext">After taking Intro to Photography in term 1 of the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College,
            I picked out my personal favourite photograph. Taking images has always been a part of me, but it’s more than just taking an image for the sake of it. Seeing images in different perspectives and moments is what it’s all about,photographs have purpose and meaning.</p>
