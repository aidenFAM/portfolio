# portfolio

There were many challenges I faced during the process of this Portfolio creation and there were many ways I overcame the difficulties. 
To begin, I had trouble with understanding how I was going to recreate my prototype from my UX class, I was aware that there were going to be thigns in whihc I had never done before on Visual Studio Code. From then on, I took everything step by step, making sure each tag, each element worked properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Next, Bootstrap was extremely difficult to overcome and understand. I had never done this before, and so applying it to my Final Portfolio was not going to be easy. I overcame this challenge by looking at example online, looking at demos, and practicing and applying to my on code, and even asking for advice from some of my peers.It was also difficult to judge what I was coding, because I did not recieve my midterm feedback until hours before this due date, which lead me to missnig some important points that I could have recieved. I have learned quite a bit in terms of what it takes to build a portfolio piece by code and what it takes to perfect every tag. I have learned that coding requires patience and problem-solving, so especially in this portfolio piece i needed to solve a lot of issues by asking for help, whether it was google, examples,going back to the past work from Brightspace peer help, e.t.c. I needed to work really hard in order to maintain a high level of focus, and everythign needed to be precise in my coding. Overall, this was a very rough process to code my UX Portfolio although I did learn a lot during the process of creating it.</
